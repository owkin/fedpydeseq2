# Federated algorithms

In this sub-module of the `fedpydeseq2` package, we implement
federated algorithms that are used multiple times.

## Federated trimmed mean: [compute_trimmed_mean](compute_trimmed_mean.md)

## Dispersions grid search: [dispersions_grid_search](dispersions_grid_search.md)

## Federated IRLS: [fed_irls](fed_irls.md)

## Federated Prox Quasi Newton [fed_PQN](fed_pqn.md)
