| 1 | gene\_names | Index | $(G,)$ | The gene names. | Each center | Server |
| 1 | \_squared\_logres | float | $()$ | The squared mean absolute deviation of the difference between the log of the genewise dispersions and the log of the fitted dispersions, restricted to the non-zero genes whose gene-wise dispersions are above $100\times \texttt{min\_disp}$. The mean absolute deviation estimate is defined as the median of the absolute difference between the log residual and its median, scaled by the percent point function of the normal distribution at $0.75$. | Each center | Server |
| 1 | prior\_disp\_var | float | $()$ | A prior on the variance of the log dispersions around the log trend curve $\sigma_{\texttt{trend}}^2$, estimated as the maximum between $0.25$ and $\texttt{\_squared\_log\_res} - \psi_1((n-p)/2)$, where $\psi_1(f/2)$ is the variance of the log of a $\chi^2_f$ distribution. For more details, see \citep{love2014deseq2}. | Each center | Server |
| 1 | refitted | nparray | $(G,)$ | A boolean array marking genes which can be replaced and which, after replacing the count value by the imputation value, are non-zero. | Each center | Server |
| 1 | replaced | nparray | $(G,)$ | A boolean array marking genes $g$ for which the Cook's distance is above the cutoff value for any sample in any center (the union of the local genes to replace across all centers). | Each center | Server |

| 1 | p\_values | nparray | $(G,)$ | For each gene, the p-value of the Wald statistic, computed from the survival function of the normal distribution applied to the wald statistic, and set to $\texttt{nan}$ if the gene is a Cook's outlier if $\texttt{cooks\_filter}$ is enabled. | Each center | Server |
| 1 | contrast | list |  | A list of three strings representing the contrast of interest, in case it is not specified by the user. Of the form $\texttt{[factor, level1, level2]}$. For example, $\texttt{[stage, Advanced, Non-advanced]}$. | Each center | Server |

| 1 | fitted\_dispersions | nparray | $(G,)$ | For each gene $g$ with zero counts across all centers, $\texttt{nan}$. For each non-zero gene $g$, either $\alpha_{\texttt{trend}}(\overline{Z}_g)$ if the disp\_function\_type is "parametric" (i.e., the fitting of the parameters has converged), or $\texttt{mean\_disp}$ otherwise (i.e., if the disp\_function\_type is "mean"). Denoted with $\alpha^{\texttt{trend}}_g$. | Each center | Server |
| 1 | non\_zero | nparray | $(G,)$ | A boolean array indicating which genes have non-zero counts in at least one center. | Each center | Server |
| 1 | genewise\_dispersions | nparray | $(G,)$ | For each gene $g$, the current estimate of the dispersion parameter $\alpha_g$. This estimate is computed by first computing the global nll (summing all local nlls)  as well as the global Cox-Reid regularization term, which is half the log determinant of the sum of the local Cox-Reid matrices. The Cox-Reid regularized nll per gene and per dispersion in the grid is obtained by summing the regularization term and the nll. Finally, for every gene, the dispersion parameter is estimated by taking the minizer of this regularized nll on the grid of size $N_{\texttt{gs}}$. | Each center | Server |
| 1 | dispersions | nparray | $(G,)$ | The estimated dispersions for each gene, which are the MAP dispersions if the gene is not an outlier w.r.t. the trend curve, and the gene-wise dispersions otherwise. | Each center | Server |
| 1 | MAP\_dispersions | nparray | $(G,)$ | For each gene $g$, the current estimate of the MAP dispersion parameter $\alpha_g$. This estimate is computed by first computing the global nll (summing all local nlls)  as well as the global Cox-Reid regularization term, which is half the log determinant of the sum of the local Cox-Reid matrices, and the regularization coming from the prior on the log dispersions around the trend curve. The Cox-Reid, prior regularized nll per gene and per dispersion in the grid is obtained by summing the regularization terms and the nll. Finally, for every gene, the MAP dispersion parameter is estimated by taking the minizer of this regularized nll on the grid of size $N_{\texttt{gs}}$. | Each center | Server |
